-------------------------------------------------------------------------
01) Start Visual C++ IDE.

02) Click On "File > New > Project” Menu Item. A "New Project” Dialog Box Will Appear.

03) From Its Left Pane Select: Installed > Templates > Visual C++ > Win32 
    And From Its Right Pane, Select ”Win32 Project”.

04) In This Same Dialog Box, Below, In "Name" Edit Box, Type Project Name, Say “MyWindow”.

05) Then Just Below, There Is "Location" Edit Box. 
    Location Means "Where You Want To Put Your Project". 
    So Either Type Path Of Desired Location Folder Or 
    Browse To Location Folder By Clicking On Adjacent Browse Button.

06) Keep Both "Create directory for solution” And “Add to Source Control” 
    Check Boxes Unchecked.

07) Click "Ok" To Proceed.

08) Now "Win32 Application Wizard" Appears".
    In Its Left Pane, Click On “Application Settings” And Then In Its Right Pane,
    Check “Windows application” Radio Button And Also Check “Empty project" Check Box.
    As Soon As We Do This, The “ATL” Check Box Gets Greyed.
    See That “Precompiled header” Check Box Is Checked/Greyed And
    Also Leave “Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) Checkbox Checked By Default.

09) Press "Finish" To Proceed.

10) Up till Now Title Bar Of VC++ IDE Was Showing "Microsoft Visual Studio” As Its Title. 
    After Above Step, It Will Start Showing Name Of Your Project Too.

11) The IDE Usually Opens With Its Workspace With Solution Explorer.

12) In Solution Explorer, On Project Name Hive, Right Click To Get Context Menu.
    In It Select Add > New Item Menu Option

    Or

    This Can Also Be Done From IDE’s Project > Add New Item Menu Option

    A “Add New Item” Dialog Box Will Appear. 

13) In Its Left Pane, Select Visual C++ > Code And In Its Right Pane,
    Select “C++ File(.cpp)” Item.

14) In This Same Dialog Box, Below, In "Name" Edit Box, Type File Name, Say “MyWindow.cpp”.

15) In “Location” Edit Box Just Confirm Whether There Is Project’s Path Or Not.
    Usually It Is.

16) A Window With Your File Name Will Appear In The Workspace Editor.
    Start Typing The Win32 Generic Application's Code And Save It.

17) Now Go To "Build" Menu Of IDE And Follow One Of The Following Ways
    a) First Click On "Compile" Option, 
       Then On "Build <project name>” Or “Rebuild <project name>” Option.
       Finally Go To IDE’s “Debug” Menu And Click On “Start Without Debugging” Option
       Or Press Ctrl+F5 To Execute The Application.

    b) First Click On "Rebuild <project name>" Menu, Then Go To IDE’s “Debug” Menu 
       And Click On “Start Without Debugging” Option Or Press Ctrl+F5 To Execute The Application.

18) After 7th Step, A Directory Of Our Project Name Is Created At Our
    Chosen Location And After 17th Step, A Subdirectory Named "Debug"
    Is Created Under Above Directory. This "Debug" Directory Contains
    Our Exe File. Note That Exe File Has The Name Of Project And Not Of
    Any File In The Project.

    NOTE : This "Debug" Subdirectory Gets Created Automatically Because
           Our Project's "Active Configuration" Is By Default "Debug".
           Another Such Configuration Is "Release". If This Is Chosen
           Then Instead Of "Debug" Subdirectory We Would Have "Release"
           Subdirectory And Our Exe Would Be Inside It.

           Actually Whether To Set Active Configuration To "Debug" Or
           To "Release" Depends Upon Stage Of Program Development.
           Means If Program Is Under Development, We Should Set It To
           "Debug" i.e. Which Is By Default Set. But If We Think That
           Our Program Is Ready For Deployment, We Should Set It To
           "Release". To Do Above Setting, Go To The Menu "Build" And
           Select "Set Active Configuration" Menu Item Where You Will
           Found That "Debug" Is Set "By Default".

19) You Can Execute\Run The Application By One Of The Following 4 Ways

    a) Click On “Debug” Menu And Then Click On “Start Without Debugging”
    b) Open "My Computer" Or "Explorer", Navigate To Your Project's
       "Debug" ( Or "Release" ) Directory And Double Click On Your
       Project's Exe.
    c) Go To "Start\Run", Browse To Navigate Your Exe's Path And When
       Found Press "Ok" Button Of "Run" Dialog Box.
    d) As Usual Start "Command Prompt", Go To The Path Of Project's Exe
       By One Or More "CD" Commands, Type Exe's Name And Press Enter
       To Execute It.

20) From “File” Menu Choose “Close Solution” And/Or Choose “Exit” 
    To Close The Visual Studio 2015 IDE.
